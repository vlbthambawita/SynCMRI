# Balancing Fidelity, Utility, and Privacy in Synthetic Cardiac MRI Generation: A Comparative Study
___

## Abstract

Deep learning in cardiac MRI (CMR) is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations. This study systematically benchmarks three generative architectures-Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Flow Matching (FM) for synthetic CMR generation. Utilizing a two-stage pipeline where anatomical masks condition image synthesis, we evaluate generated data across three critical axes: fidelity, utility , and privacy. This work quantifies the trade-offs between computational efficiency, cross-domain generalization, and patient confidentiality, establishing a framework for safe and effective synthetic data augmentation in medical imaging.
